# Metric-Imperial Converter

This project was done as a part of  Quality Assurance course on Freecodecamp and is a exact replica of https://metric-imperial-converter.freecodecamp.rocks/.

This project converts Imperial units to metric units and vice versa. This project is implmented as an API. You can request the same service from other apps by making a GET request. You can send data using and get a post methods. You can use mathematical expressions in the input. You can also put the units in the form and the output will be shown below. 

Use the units without space like `1.5km` rather than `1.5 km`. 

The tests for the program are written using `chai` and `mocha`. You can run the tests with `npm test` or setting the `NODE_ENV=test` in the `.env` file. 

When you enter invalid number or unit, the api sends the text, `invalid unit` or `invalid number` or `invalid number and unit`. 

The project is hosted on replit: [https://Metric-Imperial-Converter-Project.sathishkannan16.repl.co](https://Metric-Imperial-Converter-Project.sathishkannan16.repl.co).
